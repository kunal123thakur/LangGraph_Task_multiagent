# 🧠 Modular LangChain Agent Workflow
This project implements a modular agent workflow using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). It features a planning agent, a tool executor, and a feedback loop to iteratively refine tasks based on tool outputs

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-agent-workflow.git
   cd langchain-agent-workflow
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

   ```
   GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key_here
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Application

To start the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will prompt you to enter a query. It will then process the query through the planning and tool agents, displaying the results in the terminl.

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

**Input:**

```
Who is Virat Kohli?
```

**Output:**

```
Output from node 'PlanAgent':
---
{'task': 'Search for information about Virat Kohli', 'input': 'Who is Virat Kohli?', 'result': '', 'history': []}

Output from node 'ToolAgent':
---
{'result': 'Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the Indian national team...'}
```

## 🛠️ Tools Included

- **Calculator Too**: Performs basic arithmetic operatons.
- **Web Scraper Too**: Simulates web scraping for a givenURL.
- **Mock Too**: Returns a mock response for testing purpses.

## 🧩 Modular Deign

The project is structured to promote modulrity:

- **Agens**: Defined in `agent.py`, handling planning and tool exection.
- **Toos**: Located in the `tools/` directory, each tool is in its own mdule.
- **Application Entry Poit**: `app.py` initializes the workflow and handles user interation.

## 📈 Visualizing the Worflow

To visualize the LangGraph workflow, you can use the `graphviz` lbrary:

1. **Install Graphviz**

   ```bash
   pip install graphviz
   ```

2. **Generate the Graph**

   In your Python script:

   ```python
   from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
   from graphviz import Digraph

   # Assuming 'workflow' is your StateGraph instance
   dot = workflow.get_graph().to_dot()
   with open("workflow.dot", "w") as f:
       f.write(dot)

   # Convert to PNG
   import os
   os.system("dot -Tpng workflow.dot -o workflow.png")
   ```


   This will generate a `workflow.png` file visual
